- 👋 Hi, I’m @LoganDennis
- 👀 I’m interested in cars, **massive star asteroseismology** and bees!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to conduct asteroseismic analysis on $\gamma$ Doradus and SPB stars.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything right now, because I am still learning the basics.
- 📫 How to reach me: l.dennis4@ncl.ac.uk 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was in Hurricane Irma when it hit Florida, and was stranded there long enough for my classmates to start saying I was dead.
